# Face-Recognition-using-Open-CV
I have Developed face Recognition project using open-cv .
Face is geting from real time cemara.

# 
I was developed my own face trained face recognition using open-cv.
Face Recognition mainly involve three Functions.


  # 1.Face data collection:
         > We need to collect each human face in 30 sample Using web camera.
         > The 'haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml' file using to detect face for raw Image
         > Then store it Dataset folder.
# 2.Face Enrollment or Training 
          > Extract LBP Feature in each faces.
          > LBP Features is apply to face recognition model using 'haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml'
          > Train all images to model
# 3.Verification:
           > Verify the new face using web cam.

# 

This is my basic face recognition project usig Open-CV in python.
